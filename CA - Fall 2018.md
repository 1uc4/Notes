# CA - Fall 2018

## Lecture 1
* Think outside of the box
* Being aware of how things function in the abstractions levels _below_ yours can sometimes be the only way to reason about problems.
* Solutions may span different levels of the "computing stack".
* DRAM Arch:
  * Cell Refresh API hardcoded at 64ms. Big waste of energy and performance, especially at scale.
* RAIDR: 
  * a technique thaw would allow increase in performances and reduce energy consumptions by exploiting the fact that certain memory cells have higher retention times.
  * uses bloom filters to implement set membership for cells that _must_ be refreshed in the 64ms range or not.
